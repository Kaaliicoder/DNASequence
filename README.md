The following program was written in C program to read and store DNA Sequence in a Linked List data structure and detect how many time a squence is repeated.

How to run the Code:                                                                                                                                                                               
1- Download and Open the DNA Sequence Detection.c                                                                                                                                               
2- Make sure C and DNAsequences.txt are in same directory.                                                                                                                                                            
3- Run the Code.
